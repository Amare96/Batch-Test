<h1>TOP 5 Festivals you need to go to</h1>

<h2> Rocking The Dasies</h2>

<p>When you add sun, music, fun and international acts, what do you get?
Rocking The Dasies of course, which is one of Cape Town's hottest festivals
and locally brewed. Founded by local beatbox veteran George Avakian and a few friends,
mostly more attractive for the hip hop crowd whilst also catering for the EDM nation</p>
<BR>

<p>The festival is a 2 day event with international headliners and some of the freshest local acts,
and tickets sell out fast as the have brought acts such as <i>Mick Jenkins, 6lack, Mac Miller</i> just to name a few.
